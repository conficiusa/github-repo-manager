## Quick Start

Here's a quick overview of the steps to get started:

1. Install the tool: `pip install github-repo-manager`
2. Obtain a GitHub personal access token
3. Run the tool: `github-repo-manager`
4. Follow the interactive prompts

## Basic Command-Line Usage

After [installation](../../introduction/installation) and [setup](../../introduction/setup), try these basic commands:

### List All Your Repositories

To view all your GitHub repositories in the interactive selector:

```bash
github-repo-manager --dry-run
```

The `--dry-run` flag ensures no changes will be made - it's perfect for exploring your repositories.

### Filter Repositories by Name Pattern

To find repositories matching a specific pattern:

```bash
github-repo-manager --pattern "test-" --dry-run
```

This will show only repositories with names containing "test-".

### Filter by Visibility

To show only public or private repositories:

```bash
# Show only private repositories
github-repo-manager --visibility private --dry-run

# Show only public repositories
github-repo-manager --visibility public --dry-run
```

## Interactive UI Navigation

When you run GitHub Repository Manager, you'll see an interactive interface:

![Interactive UI](/screens/screen-1.png)

Navigate this interface using:

- **↑/↓ Keys**: Move up and down through repositories
- **Space**: Select/deselect the current repository
- **PgUp/PgDn**: Navigate between pages of repositories
- **a**: Select all repositories
- **n**: Deselect all repositories
- **Enter**: Confirm your selection
- **q**: Quit without making changes

## Making Your First Repository Operation

Let's walk through a simple example of selecting and operating on repositories:

1. **Start in dry-run mode**:
   ```bash
   github-repo-manager --pattern "temp-" --dry-run
   ```

2. **Navigate and select repositories**:
   - Use arrow keys to navigate
   - Press Space to select repositories
   - Press Enter when you're ready

3. **Review your selection**:
   - You'll see a summary of selected repositories
   - Confirm to proceed (in dry-run mode, no changes will be made)

4. **Remove the dry-run flag for actual operations**:
   ```bash
   github-repo-manager --pattern "temp-"
   ```
   This time, after confirmation, the operations will actually be performed.

## Basic Library Usage

If you're a Python developer, you can use GitHub Repository Manager in your scripts:

```python
from github_repo_manager import GitHubRepoManager

# Initialize the manager
manager = GitHubRepoManager()

# Get repositories matching a pattern
repos = manager.get_repositories(filter_pattern="test-")

# Perform operations (with dry-run for safety)
manager.bulk_delete(repos, dry_run=True)
```

## Examples

### Example 1: Clean Up Test Repositories

```bash
# First preview what would be deleted
github-repo-manager --pattern "test-" --dry-run

# Then perform the actual operation
github-repo-manager --pattern "test-"
```

### Example 2: Review All Private Repositories

```bash
github-repo-manager --visibility private --dry-run
```

### Example 3: Non-Interactive Deletion

If you're sure about what you want to delete and don't need the interactive UI:

```bash
# Be careful with this command - it will delete without interactive selection
github-repo-manager --pattern "temp-" --no-confirm
```

## Next Steps
