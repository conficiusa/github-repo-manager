## Creating a GitHub Personal Access Token

To use GitHub Repository Manager, you need a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) with the proper permissions:

1. Go to [GitHub Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens → Tokens (classic)](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
2. Click "Generate new token" → "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Give your token a descriptive name (e.g., "GitHub Repository Manager")
4. Set an expiration date (or choose "No expiration" if needed)
5. Select the following permissions:
   - For basic repository operations: check the `repo` scope
   - For organization repositories: also check `admin:org` scope
6. Click "Generate token"
7. **Important**: Copy and save the token immediately in a secure location. GitHub will only display it once!

## Authentication Methods

GitHub Repository Manager supports multiple ways to provide your authentication credentials:

### Method 1: Interactive Prompt

If you don't provide credentials, the tool will prompt you for them:

```bash
github-repo-manager
# You'll be prompted for your GitHub token and username
```

This is secure but requires you to enter credentials each time.

### Method 2: Command Line Arguments

You can provide credentials directly via command line arguments:

```bash
github-repo-manager --token YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN --username YOUR_USERNAME
```

**Note**: This method may expose your token in command history. Use with caution.

### Method 3: Environment Variables (Recommended)

Set these environment variables to avoid entering credentials repeatedly:

```bash
# On Linux/macOS
export GITHUB_TOKEN=your_token_here
export GITHUB_USERNAME=your_username

# On Windows (Command Prompt)
set GITHUB_TOKEN=your_token_here
set GITHUB_USERNAME=your_username

# On Windows (PowerShell)
$env:GITHUB_TOKEN="your_token_here"
$env:GITHUB_USERNAME="your_username"
```

For permanent configuration, add these to your shell profile or environment variables.

## Testing Your Configuration

To verify your setup, run:

```bash
github-repo-manager --dry-run
```

You should see a list of your repositories without any authentication errors.

## Security Best Practices

1. **Never share your personal access token** or expose it in public repositories
2. Set an appropriate expiration date for your token
3. Use the principle of least privilege - only grant the permissions needed
4. Consider using environment variables instead of command line arguments
5. Revoke and regenerate tokens periodically

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter authentication issues:

1. **"Bad credentials" error**: Verify your token is correct and not expired
2. **Access denied errors**: Check that your token has the right scopes
3. **Rate limit issues**: GitHub API has rate limits; the tool automatically adds delays between operations, but you might need to wait if you hit limits

## Next Steps

With authentication properly configured:

- Learn the [basic usage](../../usage/getting-started) of the tool
- Explore [configuration options](../../usage/configuration) for customization
- Check out [examples](../../usage/customization) for common scenarios
