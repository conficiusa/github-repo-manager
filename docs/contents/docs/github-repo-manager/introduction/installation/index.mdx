## Prerequisites

Before installing GitHub Repository Manager, ensure you have:

- Python 3.6 or higher installed
- pip (Python package installer)
- A GitHub account
- A GitHub personal access token with the `repo` scope (we'll cover how to create this in the [setup guide](../setup))

## Installation Methods

### Via pip (Recommended)

The simplest way to install GitHub Repository Manager is through pip:

```bash
pip install github-repo-manager
```

This will download and install the package and its dependencies from PyPI (Python Package Index).

### Install from Source

For development purposes or to get the latest unreleased features, you can install directly from the source code:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/conficiusa/github-repo-manager.git
cd github-repo-manager
```

2. Install the package in development mode:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

This creates a link to the source directory, allowing you to modify the code and see changes without reinstalling.

## System-specific Notes

### Windows

On Windows, ensure Python is added to your PATH environment variable. You may need to use:

```bash
py -m pip install github-repo-manager
```

### Linux/macOS

You might need to use `pip3` explicitly or install with user permissions:

```bash
pip3 install --user github-repo-manager
```

## Dependencies

GitHub Repository Manager automatically installs these dependencies:
- `requests`: For GitHub API communication
- `blessed`: For the interactive terminal UI

## Verification

To verify your installation:

```bash
github-repo-manager --help
```

This should display the help message with all available commands and options.

If you installed with `--user` on Linux/macOS and the command isn't found, ensure your local bin directory is in your PATH.

## Upgrading

To upgrade to the latest version:

```bash
pip install --upgrade github-repo-manager
```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter installation issues:

1. Ensure you have the latest version of pip:
   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade pip
   ```

2. Check your Python version:
   ```bash
   python --version
   ```

3. If you get permission errors, try:
   ```bash
   pip install --user github-repo-manager
   ```

## Next Steps

Once successfully installed:
1. [Configure your GitHub token](../setup)
2. Try the [getting started guide](../../usage/getting-started)
3. Learn how to [customize operations](../../usage/customization)
